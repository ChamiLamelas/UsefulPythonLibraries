# Useful Python Libraries

Some miscalleneous Python functions, classes I always end up reimplementing.

Also, this includes a customized Python .gitignore copied from [here](https://github.com/ChamiLamelas/gitignore).

Note some files depend on others within this repository.

I also have a repo for C libraries [here](https://gitlab.cs.tufts.edu/slamel01/conditionalcompilation).
